State revenue service of Latvia public income declaration "parser".

This is a script I made during international hackathon "Hacks for transparency 
2012", competition organised by "Transparency International", in Vilnius, 
Lithuania.

The server side part of it sorts and stores the data.

Out team won the competition. :)



State revenue service site's terms of service do not allow bots to use their 
site so if you use this, use it manually (or if your are not sure, don't use it 
at all).

Dependencies:

    You need Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) to use it.


Usage:

    Activate it, go to state revenue service declaration page and start making 
    requests.
